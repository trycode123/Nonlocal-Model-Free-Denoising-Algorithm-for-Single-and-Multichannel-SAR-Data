# Nonlocal-Model-Free-Denoising-Algorithm-for-Single-and-Multichannel-SAR-Data

In this repository you can find the matlab code associated to the IEEE TGRS paper Nonlocal Model-Free Denoising Algorithm for Single- and Multichannel SAR Data).

This is meant as a unified framework for SAR denosining: single channel, multi-channel and interferometric phase The code has meant for reaerch purpose If you use it, please cite as the following:

H. Aghababaei, G. Ferraioli, S. Vitale, R. Zamani, G. Schirinzi and V. Pascazio, "Nonlocal Model-Free Denoising Algorithm for Single- and Multichannel SAR Data," in IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, vol. 60, pp. 1-15, 2022, Art no. 5217315, doi: 10.1109/TGRS.2021.3127109.


# Usage
You can find:
1. the matlab code of the method
   Stc_McSAR.m

2. A free available ESAR testing image
   ESAR.mat

3. Auxiliar codes
    mask_window.m
    weight_fcn.m
    Pauli_C.m

4. A demo for running the code on the available data:
    demo.m

In order to filter your specified thecode you should provide as input:

**Cin**: the covariance matrix of the image

**Patch_size**: the local window size (typical values are 3x3)

**win_size**: the search window size (typical values are 21x21 or 23x23)

**Look**: is the number of look used for estimating the covariance matrix

for more details, please refer to the paper implementation details or contact us.
